# Use Case Scenario

Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaurant near where you are driving. Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaurant? Would you accept the coupon but use it on a subsequent trip? Would you ignore the coupon entirely? What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaurant? What about a coffee house? Would you accept a bar coupon with a minor passenger in the car? What about if it was just you and your partner in the car? Would weather impact the rate of acceptance? What about the time of day?

Obviously, proximity to the business is a factor on whether the coupon is delivered to the driver or not, but what are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to them? How would you determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon?

Overview

The goal of this project is to use visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

# Data

This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver. Answers that the user will drive there ‘right away’ or ‘later before the coupon expires’ are labeled as ‘Y = 1’ and answers ‘no, I do not want the coupon’ are labeled as ‘Y = 0’. There are five different types of coupons -- less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out & take away, bar, and more expensive restaurants ($20 - $50).

Number of children: 0, 1, or more than 1
Education: high school, bachelors degree, associates degree, or graduate degree
Occupation: architecture & engineering, business & financial, etc.
Annual income: less than \$12500, \$12500 - \$24999, \$25000 - \$37499, etc.
Number of times that he/she goes to a bar: 0, less than 1, 1 to 3, 4 to 8 or greater than 8
Number of times that he/she buys takeaway food: 0, less than 1, 1 to 3, 4 to 8 or greater than 8

Contextual attributes
Driving destination: home, work, or no urgent destination
Location of user, coupon and destination: we provide a map to show the geographical location of the user, destination, and the venue, and we mark the distance between each two places with time of driving. The user can see whether the venue is in the same direction as the destination.
Weather: sunny, rainy, or snowy
Temperature: 30F, 55F, or 80F
Time: 10AM, 2PM, or 6PM
Passenger: alone, partner, kid(s), or friend(s)
Coupon attributes
time before it expires: 2 hours or one day

# Analysis Findings
* Overall acceptance rate based on this analysis is 57% on accepting the coupon overall (see Image A)
* Output demonstrates that the combined factors of frequent bar visits and being over the age of 25 are strongly associated with a higher likelihood of accepting a bar coupon
* Drivers most likely to accept bar coupons are frequent bar-goers (1–3 times/month), single, living alone, younger (under 30), and lower-income, especially those who visit cheap restaurants often. High-income drivers who rarely visit cheap restaurants are least likely to accept. Lifestyle and financial factors drive acceptance more than demographics alone.

# Next Steps
Further analysis can be done to include other variables not included in this project. 
Considerations: weather, destination, time, gender, coupon expiration
